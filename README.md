# Personal-Project-Hub
 A sort of linktree for ease of access to my personal projects.


## To elaborate, here is a description for each project:
# Arvest-Client Project
This project was created for a client project aiming at modernizing Arvest's marketing.

I made a simple markup with functionality to count expenses, along with giving savings advice.

To run, simply go into the directory of the program and run the python script.
# CLI Wordle Games
These are just simple games I made as a sort of "litmus test" for a working knowledge of a programming language. 

# Chatroom App
I developed this full-stack, web socket-powered chatroom web application complete with login and registration system, storing users in global state on server.

To run this application, the README in its folder is self-explanatory.

# Compliments
This is a VSCode extension I developed as a simple way to give words of affirmation to programmers. However, changing the compliments to insults does make for a funny prank.

This project's README is very self explanatory.

# Robotics Code
This is the source code for many of my robotics ventures, where I, being interested in overoptimizing the robot's motion, developed a complex movement algorithim, which includes an absolue positioning system with closed-loop control.

# Todo-List-App
As a first project to introduce myself to parts of web development, I made a simple app to store tasks server side using React and ExpressJS.

# Walmart-Data-Science
This folder contains many programs I used as a proof-of-concept for predicting time series data important to Walmart distribution centers.
