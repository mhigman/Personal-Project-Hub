# SCARA Control

This library uses inverse kinematics to make simple position control for a SCARA robot that uses RMDL actuators as joints and has a veritical stepper motor.

It is dependent on the RMDLAdafruit Arduino library and the Accelstepper library to allow for better control of the SCARA robot.

This library was mostly meant to move the robot arm to a given position, but later implimentations may allow for path following, with the motion profile generator located in the extras folder.

Note: This library is incomplete. Modifications need to be done.
